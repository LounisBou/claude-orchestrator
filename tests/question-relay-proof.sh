# question-relay-proof.sh - no operator question lost at a succession, proven on a live machine.

#   tests/question-relay-proof.sh --dry
#   tests/question-relay-proof.sh --state <dir> --module <dir> [--screen '<command>']

#
# NOT part of `run-tests.sh`: the live run watches the installed release while a person makes a
# home succession, during an open decision wave, with the coordinator's pane open. The script
# drives nothing and starts no session: it samples, every 5 seconds by default for 180, the
# round under <state>/round/, the ids the coordinator's conversation was told of
# (<state>/round-told.json), the rows of the store (<module>/store/sessions/) and, given
# --screen, the coordinator's screen as that command prints it (each read bounded by the
# interval), then judges what it sampled from the module's log (<module>/hooks-module.log and
# its .1). Each sample lands in <out> (a new directory under TMPDIR by default), kept.
#
# For every question the log says was moved to a successor (« round: moved to the successor
# <name>: <id> »), it expects:
#   - the question moved, never withdrawn: no sample shows it withdrawn or closed as handed over;
#   - it in the pane after the move: no « pane: <id> not drawn » line logged after the move,
#     and, given --screen, a screen within 20 s of the move that shows its first line;
#   - it in the pane before the successor's first measure: the same over the samples taken
#     between the move and the first one holding the successor's row;
#   - « pane: shown <id> » in the log;
#   - the coordinator's one-line notice: the id in round-told.json.
# A failed expectation prints, under it, every « not drawn » and « never drawn » line the log
# holds for that id, or « unexplained: no not drawn or never drawn line names it ». With no move
# in the window the run fails, naming the fate of each question open at its start.
#
# --dry plays three fixtures through the same sampler and judge, on a clock of its own, and
# checks each verdict: a question moved and drawn passes; one left out after the move fails with
# its « not drawn » line; one withdrawn at the hand-over fails as unmoved. It prints
# « passed (dry) » and exits 0 when the three verdicts are the expected ones.
#
# Exit: 0 passed, 1 failed, 2 usage or a missing tool.
