#!/bin/bash
# pane-e2e.sh - the coordinator's pane answered from the keyboard in a live host.
#
#   tests/pane-e2e.sh [--screens <file>] [--keep]
#
# NOT part of `run-tests.sh`, like `e2e.sh`: it drives a host session in a detached tmux
# server of its own. The host is the one logged in on this machine, on its subscription: the
# script makes no credential, asks for none and writes none. It reads the host's banner before
# it drives anything and refuses to run when the banner bills usage by the API rather than the
# subscription (ORCHESTRATOR_E2E_PLAN, `Max` by default, names the plan the banner must show).
# It types no prompt for the model: the pane is opened by its command, and the one model turn,
# the coordinator's wake in the last part, is the module's own and is interrupted once it shows.
# It skips itself without tmux, jq or the host.
#
# What it proves that the faked `$` cannot: how the host routes the keys and draws the card. A
# focused pane whose tree is taller than its body scrolls on the arrows instead of moving the
# focus, so the choices are one picker, which holds the arrows itself; a click only gives the
# pane the keys; the text field takes text only once the picker's last option has sent the ring
# there; an entry that asks two questions is answered one at a time.
#
# The host runs on its own configuration directory, which holds its login, with the user's
# settings left out (`--setting-sources project`, no MCP server) and its fullscreen layout,
# where the pane is docked beside the transcript. Everything the module writes goes to the
# sandbox: its state (ORCHESTRATOR_STATE_DIR) and its own files, the store's rows among them
# (ORCHESTRATOR_MODULE_DIR), so the fixture's rows never reach the real store. What the host
# itself keeps of a session it ran — its counters, its session record, its caches, the
# transcript of the wake — is its own bookkeeping; the transcript directory of the sandbox's
# work path is removed at the end. The prompt history's line count is said before and after.
