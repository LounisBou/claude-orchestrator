Execute the orchestrator succession described in
`orchestrator:orchestrator`. Load that skill first.

Preconditions, verify each before acting:

- the moment is quiet: no verdict pending, no agent mid-delivery;
- the project state file is current — status lives once, there — and pruned (lifecycle
  item 0);
- the orchestration's rulings file, `<briefs dir>/rulings.md`, exists and holds every ruling still
  standing, each dated and quoted, the brief's « Standing rulings » line naming it;
- the standing succession brief exists; otherwise instantiate
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/orchestrator-succession-brief.md` into the
  project's briefs directory, filling every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`, never a brief written by hand;
- its « Live state » section is filled now, from the state file's live part: its five fields
  are rewritten, the predecessor overwrites the previous handover's Live state, never appends.
  The open questions are the round's open entries of this session and its questions no answer
  of his has settled, verbatim, never summarised; `none` only after reading the round. The
  brief stays within 9,000 characters, the open-questions value apart.

Then:

1. `iterm-agent.sh list` — your own row, `self`: its tty, your home server (the first
   comma-separated field of `printenv TMUX`, `none` on tabs), the launcher's path and the
   scripts directory fill the brief's predecessor placeholders.
2. **Lint it.** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/orchestrator/scripts/brief-lint.sh <brief path>`;
   any finding is repaired before the spawn, a known false positive is named.
3. `iterm-agent.sh spawn --dir <worktree> --permission-mode auto
   --successor --prompt "Read and execute <brief path>"` — the operator's
   decision mode, or the successor stops at its first prompt in a tab nobody watches.
   The successor runs on this session's live model and effort, read on its transcript;
   `--tier`, `--model` and `--effort` are refused beside `--successor`, and a pair that
   cannot be read refuses the spawn.
   No title: `--successor` takes THIS session's own name, so the successor is the same
   `Orch : <subject>` with a reference of its own, which is what every brief cites. Where the
   launcher reads no such name, it says to type one: pass `--title "<this session's current
   name>"`, the name `ListAgents` prints for it without its bracketed reference.
   The successor runs on the model this session runs on NOW — the operator's choice, carried
   across every succession; the map binds agents, never the orchestrator (spec §27).
   `--successor` places it immediately right of this tab, between it and the first agent,
   and hands it the chain (spec §34).
4. **Name the successor to your agents.** Once the spawn is verified and the successor's name and
   reference are read in `ListAgents`, send each running agent of your own ONE message giving
   the successor's exact name and reference and saying that the successor's messages are its own
   from now on. An agent takes no word from a session it was never told of, and the successor
   cannot vouch for itself.
5. Start nothing new. Wait for the successor's "takeover confirmed"; answer its questions about state only.
   On the confirmation, send it « handed over » as your
   LAST message, with `SendMessage` to the name it confirmed from:
   a line written in your own tab reaches no one, and the successor waits on it.
   Nothing of yours is left to write; end the turn: that message is what it closes
   your tab on.
6. Never close your own tab: the successor closes it on your « handed over » message — or,
   five minutes after "takeover confirmed" without it, on a reading of your tab's screen —
   its brief says so (template step 4), and you do not run this command without that step
   in the brief.
7. Do not ask the user whether to succeed. At the gate you succeed, then you tell them.
