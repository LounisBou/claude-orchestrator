Show the orchestrator who is near the rotation gate.

1. Run `ListAgents` and keep the peer list.
2. For every file in `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/claude-orchestrator/measure/*.json`,
   print one row: session id (the file's name), `context_percent`,
   `context_tokens`, `context_window`, `model`, `updated_at` as read.
3. Read your own session's measure file —
   `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/claude-orchestrator/measure/$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID.json`,
   one JSON line the module writes on every gauge pass — and keep its figures.
4. Present one table: session, context %, tokens, window, model, updated. Mark
   sessions past the gate — 300,000 tokens (30 %) on a window of 1,000,000 tokens or more, the common case, and 80 % of a smaller window — with ⚠: that is the pre-dispatch and mid-work
   gate of the orchestrator skill, « Thresholds ».

Session ids are not agent names. If the user needs the mapping, ask each live
agent for its `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` through `SendMessage`.
