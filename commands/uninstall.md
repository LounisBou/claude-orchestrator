name: orchestrator-uninstall
description: Remove the state directory the module and the scripts keep their files in
allowed-tools: Bash(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/uninstall.sh:*), Read
---

Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/uninstall.sh` and report its output to the user.

It takes a previous install's tap off the status line and keeps the command
that followed it as written (the saved object only fills keys the line lacks,
or comes back whole when the tap was all the line held; with neither, the
`statusLine` key is removed), then removes `~/.claude/claude-orchestrator/`
whole — the measure files, the module's log with its rotation and lock, the
tap's leftovers, state files included. While a line it cannot read may still
run the tap, the tap's copy and saved object stay. Tell the user to restart their
session.

Say clearly what leaves with it, because three of those files are the operator's
own and no backup holds them: the tier map `models.json` — the bindings from
`deep`, `standard` and `light` to real model identifiers — the server catalogue
`mcp.json`, which names the servers this machine offers and the default set
every agent gets, and the prompts directory, which is the record of what every
session was launched with. Offer to copy the map and the catalogue aside before
running the script. The measure files, the tap's leftovers and the terminal
tooling's environment are all rebuilt by `/orchestrator:install`; the bindings
are not.
