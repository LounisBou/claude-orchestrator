// hooks/commands.ts
// The three commands the plugin's markdown files declare — status, progress,
// agents — answered here without a model turn: the markdown body fills a prompt
// and spends a turn gathering what it asks for, while these handlers read the
// store the supervision domain keeps and the dispatch records the launcher's
// own tool registers, and answer { text } on the spot.
//
// Why the commands are hooked rather than registered: the engine registers a
// module's commands under a bare name — letters, digits, `_` and `-`, no colon
// — and refuses a built-in's name. The bare spellings of two of these three are
// built-ins ("/status", "/agents"), so half of what this plugin wants to serve
// cannot be registered at all, while the markdown commands already hold the
// invocation spellings, the typeahead rows and the descriptions the person
// knows. A command.run hook whose matcher names a command answers for the whole
// run — its text is the output and the command beneath never runs — so the
// markdown entries stay the commands' public face and this file is their
// answer. The markdown bodies become the fallback: a handler that fails is
// skipped and its net passes the run on, so the person keeps a working command
// that spends a turn, the behaviour this file replaces rather than removes.
//
// The engine fences $ to the file that received it — never passed across an
// import — so this file spells its own env resolution, its own store read and
// its own record read, while the row parser, the staleness rule and the pane's
// row shaper cross as plain imports from the supervision domain.
