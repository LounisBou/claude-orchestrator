# The context gate, enforced by the harness rather than remembered by the model.
#
# Runs on every user prompt, and speaks only to orchestration sessions: those whose name,
# given at launch (`--name`) or by a rename, starts with `Orch :`, `Agent :`, `Audit :` or
# `Coord :` (hooks/session_name.py reads it, the same reading the stop gate uses). A session
# the operator started by hand, or one whose name cannot be read, gets nothing at all: no
# gate line, no « unmeasured » line, no model-drift line, no marker.
#
# Reads the session's measured context fill from the gauge's tap tier and, at or past the
# gate, injects one line the session cannot miss, fitted to its role: an orchestrator
# succeeds at the next quiet boundary, an agent finishes its unit and stops, an auditor
# writes its one report and stops (or, with work the operator gave it after the report still
# in hand, succeeds), the coordinator succeeds when no relay is in flight.
# Below the gate it prints nothing.
#
# The gate is 80 % of the window, or 300,000 tokens on a window of 1,000,000 tokens or more:
# the cached context is replayed on every turn, and the percent alone would let a session
# on such a window carry up to 800,000 tokens of it (skills/orchestrator/SKILL.md,
# « Thresholds »).
#
# WHY A HOOK. The rule « succession is yours to trigger, do not wait » existed in
# the skill and was not applied: an orchestrator reported its context at the gate
# and asked the user what to do. A sentence the model must remember is a sentence
# it can rationalise away; a line the harness puts in front of every prompt is not.
#
# A gate that cannot measure lets the prompt through and SAYS SO — once per
# session, not on every prompt — instead of staying silent as if the fill were low. But
# not before the tap had its chance: the status line renders only after a turn has
# answered, so a session's very first prompt has no tap file yet by construction, and
# saying "unmeasured" there is a false alarm, not a finding.
# Nor when the tap file is merely old: the gauge then reads the transcript against the
# window the file carries, and that reading counts. The line names what was read: no tap
# file, or a tap file the gauge could not read a figure from.
