// hooks/answered.ts
// The orchestrator's tool for an answer that reached it by a message. The operator answers in
// the coordinator's tab and the coordinator relays it: no hook sees that answer, so the entry
// stays open unless the orchestrator says it acted on it. The call marks the session's open
// question answered, by message, with the message's author. An unanswered question never
// leaves the round otherwise.

// The tool's short name: the model calls it as mcp__orchestrator__answered-by-message.
