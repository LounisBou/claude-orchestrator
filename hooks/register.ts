// hooks/register.ts
// Entry point of the hooks module: mounts the domains. Each domain lands in
// its own task; the gauge arrived first, the guards second, the store third,
// the commands fourth, the naming fifth, the moving sixth, the short commands' sync seventh;
// the round's wake and the pane's tool ride with the supervision. The gauge stays before the
// supervision: a chain answers in registration order, and the store's row
// reads the figure through the gauge's own module memory — mounted after it,
// the row would carry one measure behind. The moving comes after the supervision, whose receive
// handler passes a marked move message on and leaves the moving to consume it.
