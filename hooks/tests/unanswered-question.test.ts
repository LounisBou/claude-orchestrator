// The stop gate's rule on a question still on the operator (his ruling of 2026-11-03): an
// orchestrator's turn that ends while one of its operator questions is unanswered shows it again
// in full in its own chat. Which question is still on him is read off the
// round and the session's wait file; whether the turn shows it, off the final message.
