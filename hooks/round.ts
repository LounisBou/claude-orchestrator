// hooks/round.ts
// The coordinator's round, as the module keeps it on this machine: one file per wait an
// orchestrator ended its turn on, under the state directory's round/ (roundPath), written
// whole and renamed into place by the relay (supervision.ts) in place of a message, so a
// question waits in the round without costing the coordinator's model a turn. The pane of
// the coordinator draws the first open question whole, with its lettered choices the operator
// answers from (the entry then `answered`, by the pane); the coordinator reads the round with
// `coordinator.sh round` when the operator speaks to it, and closes an entry with
// `coordinator.sh round-close`. A file that does not parse is skipped by every
// reader, never repaired. Pure on purpose, like relay.ts: the handler holds the $.
