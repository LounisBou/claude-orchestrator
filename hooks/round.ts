// orchestrator ended its turn on, under the state directory's round/ (roundPath), written
// whole and renamed into place by the relay (supervision.ts) in place of a message, so a
// question waits in the round without costing the coordinator's model a turn. The pane of
// the coordinator draws the first open question whole, with its lettered choices the operator
// answers from (the entry then `answered` by the pane, his choice sent); the coordinator
// reads the round with `coordinator.sh round` when the operator speaks to it, and closes an
// entry with `coordinator.sh round-close`. A file that does not parse is skipped by every
// reader, never repaired. Pure on purpose, like relay.ts: the handler holds the $.
