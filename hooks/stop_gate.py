"""stop_gate.py - the stop gate's checks, run by stop-gate.sh on the host's Stop event.

Reads the host's payload on stdin (`session_id`, `cwd`, `last_assistant_message`,
`stop_hook_active`, `transcript_path`). Refuses a stop by printing
`{"decision": "block", "reason": …}`; lets it pass by printing nothing. Acts only in an
orchestrator's session, one whose name starts with `Orch :`. That scope is decided first,
from the session's own tty and its name, before any call to the launcher: the name is the
one the session was launched with (`--name`, read from the process table by the launcher's
own code) or, when it was launched without one, the last `custom-title` entry the host
wrote into the transcript when the session was renamed. The launcher's listing is read only
for a session that is an orchestrator.

Check 1, what will wake you. The stop passes when an agent of this orchestrator is busy
(its idle notice will wake the orchestrator), when the message ends on the machine line
`waiting: operator — blocks: <what it blocks>`, or when it ends on `waiting: done` and the
facts agree: no checkout of the project in `workspace.sh list`, no agent of this
orchestrator still there, and no row still open in the dispatch records the session
registered (a decision deferred « to plan after the round » opens a row; the row is the
memory). The message's last line is matched after normalisation: markup, a quote or a bullet
mark, the dash, the case and the spacing a model writes it with are all read as the line.
The agents of this orchestrator are the entries of the chain the
launcher keeps for its tty, those its own session wrote (`chain_owned`, the session read
from ITERM_SESSION_ID, the same id the launcher stores as the owner). An agent's state is
the activity glyph its tab title carries in the listing: `✳` idle, a spinner glyph busy, no
glyph at all no agent running there.

Check 1 first refuses, whatever the machine line says and whatever another agent is doing,
while an agent of this orchestrator is idle and its pull request is OPEN or MERGED: its
delivery is over, its tab is only left behind, and the refusal names it with « stand it down
now ». The pull request is found from the agent's tty alone: the working directory of the
host process there (the launcher's `host_cli_cwd`), that checkout's branch, and one
`gh pr view <branch> --json number,state` per idle agent, none for a busy one. A read that
fails or runs past the deadline is a log line and counts as no pull request.

Check 2, the real CI state, runs only when Check 1 let the stop pass. Each open pull
request of the operator's own (`--author @me`) in the session's repository whose head differs from the head this hook last
reported for this session is read with `gh pr checks`; any check pending or failing refuses the stop with the real
state. A head is recorded with its state: `pending` once a stop has refused it while its
checks were pending, `done` once they have all finished. A pending head refuses once; it
passes at the next stops until a check fails, and refuses again then, once per failing set
(the failing names are kept with the record). A head whose checks finished green is recorded
done and passes; one that finished red refuses once, unless that failure was already told.
A moved head starts over. A head whose check list is still empty (a push seen before its
checks are registered) is not green but unread: it is not recorded either. It reads facts, never the words of the message:
a list of claim words fails open on any rewording and in any language.

The sweep, run last and never part of the decision. Once the checks have let the stop pass,
an orchestrator's stop also runs `workspace.sh sweep` — the checkouts and host temporary
directories whose purpose is over — with what is left of the hook's deadline, minus a margin,
at most once per ten minutes (a stamp file in the state directory). A refused stop runs none:
the host reads the decision at the hook's exit, and a refusal never waits on a sweep. Each
deletion is logged; a sweep that fails or overruns is logged and never changes the outcome
of the stop.

The whole hook runs under one deadline, checked between external calls: past it the stop
passes and one line is logged.

Its own failures never block: a missing tool, an unreadable listing or a network error lets
the stop pass and appends one line to `<state>/stop-gate.log`, beside one line per refusal
and per `blocks:` stop. The figures that say whether the gate earns its cost are read there.

WHY A HOOK. « Never end a turn on announced work » and « a fact you did not read is a fact
you do not state » existed as rules and did not hold: an orchestrator announced an agent and
ended its turn with none running, and twice stated a pull request's checks before they had
finished. Both happen at one moment, the stop, and the harness holds that moment.
