// The shared store: one row per live session — the figures the gauge measured,
// the name the walk read, the repository of the working directory — written by
// this file's own session.measure handler and removed by its session.end, one
// file per key under the module's state root. The supervision pane below reads
// the same rows, opened when the person types /coordinator-supervision or
// /orchestrator-supervision — never on a start: the operator wants nothing placed
// on screen unasked — and in a coordinator, by the module itself once, at the end
// of its first turn while the coordinator's record names one: his ruling of
// 2026-10-18. In a coordinator session it lists the orchestrators, and under them
// the first question of its round (round.ts); in an orchestrator session,
// that orchestrator's own agents, read from the launcher's chain and the host's
// session records; in any other role it opens nothing. The commands hold no $ of
// the writing side and read the same files through their own $.fs calls plus
// the pure row parser and the urgency sort below.
//
// The engine fences $ to the file that received it — never passed across an
// import — so this file spells its own env resolution, its own log stamp, its
// own origin read and its own transcript-window reader, while the figures
// cross as a plain import (currentReading, no $ argument) and the name runs
// over the walk's pure core with readers built here.
