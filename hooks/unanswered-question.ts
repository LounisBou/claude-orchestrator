// The stop gate's rule on a question still on the operator, the operator's ruling of 2026-11-03:
// an orchestrator asks the coordinator (its pane, or its session when the pane is closed) and,
// at the same time, its own chat, where he must see the question too, at every turn's end until
// he answers it. A question once asked and then lost from the chat left him unaware of what the
// orchestrator waited on. Pure: the stop gate reads the round and the session's wait file, this
// file decides on what they hold and on the turn's final message.

// settles it wherever he gives it: in the pane or to the coordinator, or typed in the sender's own
// tab, which withdraws it at once (supervision.ts withdrawOnTyped); a turn that ends on the same
// wait opens it again, and it is pending again. An entry with no numbered question block asks
// nothing the chat could show again and is passed over. With no such entry in this machine's
// round, the wait file's operator wait relayed to a coordinator elsewhere (held, or sent and not
// yet acknowledged) is the question; an entry of the same wait in the round, whatever its status,
