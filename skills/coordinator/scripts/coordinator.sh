# The entries are read from
# <state>/round/<id>.json, one JSON entry per file, written whole by the hooks module at the end
# of a turn of an orchestrator on this machine (hooks/round.ts); a file that does not parse is
# skipped. Each set is in the round's order: grouped by sender, the groups by their earliest
# wait, each in the order its waits began.
# round-close rewrites the entry with status closed and the answer {text, by "coordinator", at},
# in one rename, and refuses an id with no entry.
# drop prints "dropped <name>", then "brief moved to <path>" (or "brief <path> was already
# gone"), then "left untouched: <each pull request and checkout, or none>" — the pull requests,
# their branches and the checkouts are the operator's to close, never this script's.

#   pr <repository>#<n> | <branch> | unknown | session <pid> in <directory>: brief <path> cannot be read
# or one « unknown » line per pull request where the chain breaks or allows two answers:
#   pr <repository>#<n> | <branch> | unknown | no checkout on <branch>
#   pr <repository>#<n> | <branch> | unknown | no session in <checkout>, <checkout>...
#   pr <repository>#<n> | <branch> | unknown | no session in <checkout>..., beside a session in <checkout>...
#   pr <repository>#<n> | <branch> | unknown | sessions <pid>, <pid> in <directory> name different orchestrators: <o>, <o>
#   pr <repository>#<n> | <branch> | unknown | head branch in a fork, owned by <owner>
# except that an « unknown » pull request a remote row lists is that row's orchestrator, and
# one a sleeping orchestrator's record lists is its:
#   pr <repository>#<n> | <branch> | <orchestrator> | remote on <machine>, updated <UTC time>
#   pr <repository>#<n> | <branch> | <name> | sleeping since <UTC time>
# A remote row's pull request in a repository this machine did not read keeps the branch « - »,
# and says so; one absent from its repository's open list is not printed (it is no longer open):
#   pr <owner/name>#<n> | - | <orchestrator> | remote on <machine>, updated <UTC time>, not read on the forge here
#
# The chain an owner is read along: the pull request's head branch, the checkouts on it, the
# host sessions working there, and the orchestrator each one names — itself when its title
# is `Orch : …`, else the address its brief gives (« orchestrator is the session **`…`** »,
# a relative brief read from the session's directory), else the one its startup prompt
# gives; « unknown » where the chain breaks or allows two answers. A repository is its
# origin's address without scheme, user or `.git`, so a checkout and its source are one
# repository; a detached checkout is on no branch. A session is a host CLI process with a
# terminal; the host's name is ORCHESTRATOR_HOST_CLI, else the launcher's own default.
#
# Sources, each replaceable for the suite: the process table (`ps`, or the file
# COORDINATOR_PS_TABLE, lines `<pid> <ppid> <tty> <command>`), the working directories
# (`lsof`, or COORDINATOR_CWDS, lines `<pid> <path>`), the checkouts (`workspace.sh list`),
# and the open pull requests (`gh pr list` in the repository, or COORDINATOR_FORGE, called
# as `<command> <repository directory>` and printing `<number> <head branch> <head>` lines,
# <head> `same` for a branch of the repository itself, `fork:<owner>` for a fork's), and the
# remote rows (`store/remote` under the config dir: one JSON row per file, written by the hooks
# module as it receives them from orchestrators on other machines; read here, never written).
#
# State: <state>/coordinator.json {"name","tty","started","pid"}; <state> is ORCHESTRATOR_STATE_DIR,
# else the plugin's directory under CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, else under ~/.claude, the launcher's
# own resolution. A registration goes through the lock directory <state>/coordinator.lock,
# waited for five seconds at most, then refused with the lock's path and its holder's pid; a
# lock is never broken automatically.
#
# The sleeping orchestrators: <state>/sleeping.json, an array of {"name","brief","dir","model",
# "effort","slept","prs","checkouts"}, written in one rename under the same lock as a
# registration — sleep, wake-done and drop each take it — and kept apart from the
# coordinator's own record, so it outlives a coordinator's succession and its end alike. A
# sleeping orchestrator is the operator's to wake or drop: nothing here acts on its own.
#
# Liveness: a session is alive when `iterm-agent.sh verify --tty <tty> --pid <pid>` finds that
# process as the host CLI on its tty, so another host CLI on a reused tty reads as dead. The
# record's pid is the host CLI's on the tty at registration, read from the « (pid N) » of
# `verify --tty <tty>`; a record with no pid, written before it was kept, is read by its tty
# alone. COORDINATOR_VERIFY names another command to run in its place, called as
# `<command> --tty <tty>` (printing « ... (pid N) » when it runs) or `<command> --tty <tty>
# --pid <pid>` (exit 0 only when that pid runs there), read the same way: exit 0 alive; exit 1
# with nothing on stderr is its « not running », and any other answer is an error, never « dead ».
#
# Exit codes: 0; 1 on a refusal or a usage error, and from `facts` when it prints a
# collision; 2 from `facts` and `owners` when a source could not be read, so an answer that
# cannot be known is never read as « no collision ».
#
# Why it exists: two orchestrations step on each other through what is checked out, what
# runs and which pull request a branch carries, and all of it can be read now. Nobody
# declares anything to the coordinator, so nothing it answers rests on what an orchestrator
# remembered to say, and no orchestrator carries a duty toward it; a reading made in prose
# would be made from memory, and that is where two sessions end up pushing to one branch.
