"""iTerm2 session management for the orchestrator, over the app's own API.

The bash entry point beside this file resolves an interpreter and hands over here.
Every subcommand keeps the name, the options, the output and the exit codes the shell
version had, because skills, commands and briefs call it by those.

Why the API rather than AppleScript. The old path TYPED the launch command into a fresh
shell, and everything expensive came from that: a command truncated past a few hundred
characters while the script reported success, a startup question eating the first
keystroke twice in one night, quoting that died on a non-ASCII byte under a C locale, and
a tab placement that needed Accessibility, the app in front, and a focus flicker per move.
`async_create_tab` takes the command and the index directly, so none of those exist here.

What did not change: the tty is still a claim, and the process on it is still the fact.
A spawn is not done until the host CLI is seen in `ps`.

#
# The fault this section exists for: one right-click left a context menu open in the app,
# and for four hours every AppleScript to it timed out while its terminals kept scrolling.
# A menu runs a NESTED, modal event loop; while one runs the main thread never returns to
# its default run loop mode and AppleEvents are NOT dispatched — they queue and expire on
# their own two-minute timeout, one after another, with nothing written to any log. The
# API library authenticates by asking the app for a cookie THROUGH AppleScript, in a
# subprocess it never bounds, so the launcher inherited an unkillable wait: `list`, `close`
# and `spawn` all hung, and a `close` printed « closed 1 session » over a session whose
# process was still running.
#
# Three answers, and each of them is a rule the rest of this file keeps:
#   - no AppleScript is ever run unbounded, here or anywhere else in this file;
#   - the app is asked the cheapest question there is BEFORE the library is entered, so a
#     wedged app is never asked for a cookie at all;
#   - when it does not answer, the cause is NAMED from a main-thread sample instead of the
#     caller being left to guess — the fault above is cleared by one keystroke, and saying
#     so is the difference between a minute and an afternoon.

# Where the AppleScripts go, what samples the app, and which app. All three are overridable
# so the suite can stand a wedged app and a healthy one side by side with no window server.

    name at all is a reconstruction longer than any name — the forty characters this file
    already refuses to let a launch line fill a terminal with. Observed on three sessions a
    hand-rolled launch had made: the listing's « who is this session » column carried a

# --- the terminal seam ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Everything the launcher asks of the terminal goes through ONE object: find a session by its
# tty, make one, list them, read a screen, close one, put one elsewhere, and say who owns a
# chain. The subcommands below call `terminal()` and never the app, so a second terminal can
# stand beside the iTerm one by implementing the same methods; the choice is made in
# `terminal()` and nowhere else.
#
# A chain entry's `tab_id` is whatever the terminal hands back for the session it made. The
# launcher stores it, compares it and writes it as an opaque string; only the terminal that
# issued it reads it as anything more. The chain FILE is the launcher's: a terminal reads it
# to answer, and never writes an entry or drops one — the subcommand that made or closed the
# session does, once it knows the outcome.
#
# `made` is what a refusal needs to close a session a spawn made, filled as soon as each part
# is known. Its keys every terminal shares: `tty`, `tab_id` (the stable id `create` returns),
# `error` (what failed once the session existed) and `terminal` (the one that made it, set by
# the caller). Any other key belongs to the terminal that wrote it and is read by it alone.

# Where `create` puts a new session. `at` is `beside` (on `side` of the session on `anchor`),
# `first` (the first place of the window holding `anchor`) or `anywhere` (where the terminal
# puts it). `read_back` says the caller reads the placement back and repairs it itself (an
# auditor's, §52), so a terminal that cannot place it need not say so.
