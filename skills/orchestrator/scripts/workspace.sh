#   workspace.sh create <source-repo> <name> [--base <branch|origin/branch>]   prints the checkout's path
#   workspace.sh pin <source-repo> <name> <ref> [--pr <n>]     a detached worktree at that commit, nothing local; prints its path
#   workspace.sh delete <path> [--discard]                     refuses unpushed work unless told; also removes the host's
#                                                              temporary directory of the path when no live process works in it
#   workspace.sh sweep [--deadline <seconds>] [--dry-run]      the leftovers, decided on facts: one line per item,
#                                                              "deleted <path>" | "kept <path>: <reason>" (a dry run says "would delete")
#   workspace.sh list                                          one line per checkout under the root (a pin reads HEAD … pinned)
#
# Root: ORCHESTRATOR_WORKSPACES, else ~/dev/workspaces. A checkout lives at
# <root>/<basename of the source>/<name>.
#
# Host temporary area: ORCHESTRATOR_HOST_TMP, else /private/tmp/claude-<uid>. The host keeps
# one directory per working directory a session ran in, named after that path with every
# character that is not a letter or a digit turned into `-` (`/a/.b_c` is `-a--b-c`; see
# `encode`); it holds the session's scratch. It leaves with its checkout (design §61).
#
# The one safety rule over every deletion here: never a dirty tree, unpushed commits (on a
# branch or on a detached head) or a stash, a pin whose head is on no branch, or a directory a
# live process has as its working directory (`lsof`, bounded; a process table that cannot be
# read is a refusal, never a « nothing there »; so is a checkout git cannot read).
# `--discard` overrides every guard on the checkout itself, a live process inside it included.
# It never overrides the guard on a host temporary directory, which `delete` and `sweep` both
# keep while a live process works in the directory it is named after or below it (a session's
# host directory is named after the directory the session started in, not after its scratch),
# or inside the host directory itself.
#
# Manifest: <repo>/.claude/workspace-manifest, one repository-relative path per line, `#`
# starts a comment; an absent path is said on stderr and skipped, and a path leaving the
# repository is refused.
#
# Why it exists: a git worktree writes into its source repository, so no single sandbox
# path contains it; a clone does, and a clone per phase makes the one-writer rule a fact
# instead of a queue. But a clone carries what git tracks and nothing else — not the
# project's local settings directory, not what its exclude file keeps out of history, not
# an environment file — so a session in it behaved like a stranger's. The copy is part of
# making the checkout, not a step after it (design §30).
#
# The script never writes the host's trust record (that is `spawn --trust`), never
# launches anything, and never touches the source. A pin writes nothing into the source
# but its worktree metadata.
