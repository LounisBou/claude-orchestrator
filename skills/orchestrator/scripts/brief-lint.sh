# brief-lint.sh — refuse a brief before it is dispatched, not after the round.
#
#   brief-lint.sh <brief-path> [--expect-created <path>]...
#
# --expect-created names a path the brief tells its session to create, so it cannot exist
# yet (an audit's report); the path check accepts exactly that path as absent. Repeatable.
#
# Prints one line per finding and exits 1 when there is any; exits 0 and says so
# otherwise. Every check is mechanical: this reads the file, it does not judge the work.
#
# Why it exists: specification is the largest category of multi-agent failure, and a brief
# is the whole specification act. Two defects reached a live agent before anything read
# the file — a path built from a variable the agent's shell does not set, and a second
# session reference sitting beside the real one, inside the rule whose point is that there
# is exactly one address.
#
# What it CANNOT check: whether the scope is right, whether the contracts are the ones the
# next phase consumes, whether the tier fits the work. Those stay the orchestrator's, and
# a green lint is not an approved brief.
