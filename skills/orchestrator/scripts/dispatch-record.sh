# dispatch-record.sh - one row per dispatch, and the signal the routing rule needs.
#
#   dispatch-record.sh open    <record> --class <c> --tier <deep|standard|light> [--label <text>] [--cascade]
#   dispatch-record.sh round   <record> <id>
#   dispatch-record.sh review  <record> <id> --head <sha> --norms tool|none
#   dispatch-record.sh fixed   <record> <id> --head <sha>   (the one correction round, verified)
#   dispatch-record.sh ready   <record> <id> --head <sha>
#   dispatch-record.sh close   <record> <id> --verdict <text>
#   dispatch-record.sh escaped <record> <id>      (a defect got past this row's review)
#   dispatch-record.sh summary <record>
#
# `open` prints the row id. The record is JSON lines: appendable, greppable, and read back
# with the `jq` the rest of this plugin already needs.
#
# Why it exists: the routing rule says a tier drop that costs a second corrective round is
# reverted for its class. Nothing measured that, so the rule could only be applied from
# memory - and an economy nobody measures is one that always looks free, because its cost
# lands rounds later where nobody attributes it. `summary` names the classes where the
# drop did not pay, so the reversion is a reading rather than an impression.
#
# `review` and `ready` carry the second rule the record is asked to hold: a pull request is
# ready only when a review session read ITS head (either side may abbreviate the other, from
# 7 characters) and the project's own norms check ran there - or when the head is the one
# correction round that review produced, which the orchestrator verified on the artifact.
# That rule was written in the rulebook and in the review brief, and was still broken three
# times in one day by a reader's opinion of the norms file standing in for the tool. A rule
# only prose carries is applied from memory, and memory forgets it; `ready` is the refusal
# prose cannot make.
#
# The record belongs to the PROJECT being built, not to this plugin: the default table
# ships here, a project's corrections belong with that project's state.
