# ci-watch.sh — the one way to wait on a pull request's checks.
#
#   ci-watch.sh <pr> [--repo <owner/repo>] [--interval <s>] [--base-workflow <name>]... [--no-base]
#
# Meant to be started by the orchestrator with the host's background run (`run_in_background`,
# timeout 7 200 000 ms), once per pull request: a command that exits on the event costs no
# token while it waits, and its exit wakes the session. Nobody watches CI in the foreground
# and nobody loops on `gh pr view` or `gh pr checks` (design, « Waiting on CI »).
#
# What it does: reads the head once; waits, bounded, for checks to be registered on it (a
# push is seen before its checks, and « no checks reported » right then is not a red); runs
# `gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast`, its output in a log file under the state directory,
# never on stdout; reads the pull request once more when the watch returns. The watch ends once
# the checks it knows are done, maybe before a slower workflow's checks are registered: every
# workflow run of the head is read, each unfinished one watched to its end (`gh run watch`),
# and the checks watched again, until none is unfinished; the wait restarts its bound,
# CI_WATCH_REGISTER_WAIT, at each run watched, and a run still unfinished past it is unread.
# Green with auto-merge enabled is not the end: the merge is coming, and nobody re-arms a watch after it,
# so the pull request is read again at the interval, bounded, until it merges.
#
# A pull request found merged, at either read, is followed onto its base branch: a flaky test
# green on the merge ref can still turn the base branch red, and nobody else watches that run.
# It reads the merge commit and the base branch, waits, bounded, for the push runs on that
# branch at that commit, and watches each to its end (`gh run watch --exit-status`, its output
# in a log file too), re-listing once they end so a run registered late is watched as well.
# A run cancelled there is no red: the branch's concurrency cancels it for a newer push, so the
# newest push run of the same workflow on that branch is followed instead, and its outcome is
# reported with its own sha. A cancelled run with no newer one is a red.
#
# stdout, one line, and the exit code the caller reads without opening the log:
#   ci-watch: green <pr> <head>                                 0  every workflow run of the head completed and
#                                                                  every check passed; with auto-merge: no merge
#                                                                  within the bound
#   ci-watch: red <pr> <head> <failing check names>             1
#                                                                  (a cancelled check is one, though the watch
#                                                                  exits 0 over it)
#   ci-watch: no-checks <pr> <head>                             2  none registered within the bound
#   ci-watch: moved <pr> <old head> <new head>                  3  re-arm on the new head
#   ci-watch: closed <pr> CLOSED                                4  closed without merge
#   ci-watch: closed <pr> MERGED                                4  merged, with --no-base only
#   ci-watch: unread <pr> <reason>                              5  gh failed, or a bad call
#   ci-watch: base-green <pr> <sha>                             0  merged, the base branch's runs green
#                                                                  (the sha of a cancelled run's successor)
#   ci-watch: base-red <pr> <sha> <run id> <failing job names>  6  the first red run on the base branch
#   ci-watch: base-no-run <pr> <sha> filtered=<n>               7  no push run within the bound
#
# `filtered` counts the push runs on that commit the workflow filter left out: above 0, a
# followed workflow is misnamed, and the operator is told.
#
# CI_WATCH_REGISTER_WAIT bounds the wait for registration, in seconds (default 180).
# CI_WATCH_MERGE_WAIT bounds the wait for an auto-merge after green, in seconds (default 1800),
# so that the whole watch stays inside the host's background bound.
# CI_WATCH_BASE_WAIT bounds the wait for a push run on the base branch, in seconds (default 600).
# Which workflows are followed there: `--base-workflow <name>` (repeatable), else
# CI_WATCH_BASE_WORKFLOWS (comma-separated names), else every push run on the merge commit.
