name: model-routing
description: Use when this session is about to dispatch another one — an implementer, a review collector and its lenses, a comments agent, a search subagent, a successor — and must choose the capability tier that closes the work in one round at the least cost, however small the job; a general question about the tiers, with nothing to dispatch, is not one.

# Model routing

**This skill is a decision aid for the orchestrator.** Its table, its readings, its escalation and its record inform your judgment: you decide the tier or the model, and the brief carries the choice and its reason. What is not a choice of tier — how the map is bound, the mode an unattended session runs in, how a round is recorded, never de-escalating inside a phase, never cascading a phase, one tier below the row and never two, the false-economy reversion, and reading the record's summary before a wave and reverting what it names — holds as written.

## The principle

**Pay for judgment that nothing downstream re-checks.** Work whose output a machine or you re-check — a test suite, a quality gate, a « nothing observable changed » diff — runs at the cheapest tier that closes it: an error there is caught cheaply. Work that nothing re-checks — your own sequencing, a contract later phases consume, the final verification — runs at the top tier, because an error there is paid N times. The target is the cheapest tier observed to close a class IN ONE ROUND, and a tier comes from readings taken before the dispatch, never from how hard the phase looks.

## Tiers and the map

Three tiers name capability: `deep`, `standard`, `light`. Their binding is the operator's, in `<state dir>/models.json`; `iterm-agent.sh resolve-tier <tier>` prints it. **Read your map before dispatching a wave.** An unbound tier is not an error: the launcher types no model argument and the host applies its default. When the tier the work needs is unbound, pick the model you judge fit — `--model <name>` on that one spawn, or the host's default taken on purpose — write the choice and its reason in the brief, and tell the operator in one line at the spawn, so he can correct it or bind the tier. You never rebind his map yourself: a binding the mode check refuses is put to him with the refusal.

**A tier is bound to a family alias, never to a versioned identifier**, which keeps naming the model it named the day it was written. The launcher warns in one line on a versioned binding, names the alias to bind instead, and launches anyway.

**A session nobody watches runs in the operator's decision mode.** A binding the host does not run in that mode is a binding to fix: rebind the tier, or spawn that agent with `--permission-mode acceptEdits` for a few edits and allow-listed commands only. The launcher reads the mode on the session's transcript and refuses the spawn when it differs. A model you choose for an unbound tier runs in the operator's decision mode, or, with no auto mode, with `--permission-mode acceptEdits`. Name the mode in the brief where you name the tier.

## The table

| Class of work | Tier | What re-reads its output |
|---|---|---|
| You, your successor, a decision round | `deep` | nobody |
| A phase that **defines a contract** a later phase consumes verbatim | `deep` | nothing until phase N+1 pays for it |
| The final verification phase (spec conformity, norms over the full diff, E2E) | `deep` | nobody |
| A behaviour phase with the contract already fixed | `standard` | the test suite, then the review round |
| A conversion phase (move, rename, extract) | `standard` | « nothing observable changed »: the suite judges |
| An N-bis corrective on a findings list | `standard` | you, on the artifact: the diff, the decisive tests |
| A review collector, a comments agent | `standard` | you verify every finding |
| The review lenses | `standard` | the collector, then you |
| Read-only search subagents | `light` | they locate; they never judge |

The tabs you launch and the subagents launched inside a session read this one table: say the lenses' tier in the review brief.

## The five readings

For a phase that does not sit plainly on a row, take these before dispatching, from the plan and the decision log:

1. **Contract novelty** — does the phase publish a signature a later phase consumes verbatim?
2. **Proof shape** — « nothing observable changed », or « the behaviour changed and a test drives it »?
3. **Blast radius** — files in scope, consumers downstream.
4. **Residual ambiguity** — questions still open on this phase in the decision log.
5. **Repair history** — findings that survived a round on this phase or its class.

Two readings high or more raises the row by **one** tier, never more, never as a running total: the readings are retaken at each dispatch.

## Escalate on evidence, one step, at a session boundary

Triggers, each a thing you have read:

- the same class of finding survives one N-bis round;
- the agent STOPs twice on the same ambiguity;
- the agent crosses the context gate without a single push.

An escalation IS a rotation — fresh session, resume brief, one tier up, the brief carrying the evidence that triggered it. **Never de-escalate inside a phase**: a drop applies to the next dispatch of that class.

## Cascade where a retry is cheap — and only there

A cascade tries one tier below the row and escalates when the result does not hold. It pays only where a failed attempt is cheap to detect and to throw away. For a phase it is not — a failed attempt costs a review round plus a rework round — so **never cascade a phase**. Three classes qualify:

| Class | What detects the failure | What a retry costs |
|---|---|---|
| A review lens | its report is empty, vague, or dies on the first verification you run | one reader, re-run |
| A read-only search subagent | it returns nothing where you know something is | one search |
| An N-bis narrow enough that the gate judges it | the project's own quality gate | one short session |

Dispatch one tier below the row and mark it — `dispatch-record.sh open … --cascade`; if it costs a round, re-dispatch at the row and close the marked row `--verdict escalated`. `summary` reports `cascade=<class> at <tier>: N of M paid` and says `stop cascading` when fewer than half pay over at least two attempts. One tier below, never two.

## The false economy

**A tier drop that produces a second corrective round is reverted for that class, and the reversion is recorded.** A rework round plus its review round costs more than the phase one tier up.

## A second reader, armed by evidence

A strong judge rarely invents a defect but misses some, and a miss leaves no trace in the round that missed it. When a later round finds a defect in work already approved, record it: `dispatch-record.sh escaped <record> <id>`. `summary` then prints `signal=double-read <class> at <tier>`, and that class's next round gets a **second reader with a DIFFERENT lens**; a finding is kept only when both see it. Not from a hunch, and never a second reader on the same lens.

## The record

One row per dispatch in the project's build state: class, tier, rounds to close, verdict. It corrects the table for this build, and your succession brief points at it. Keep it with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/orchestrator/scripts/dispatch-record.sh`:

```
dispatch-record.sh open <record> --class <c> --tier <t> --label <what>   # prints the row id
dispatch-record.sh round <record> <id>                                  # a review round happened
dispatch-record.sh review <record> <id> --head <sha> --norms tool|none  # and what it read
dispatch-record.sh fixed <record> <id> --head <sha>                     # the one correction round, verified
dispatch-record.sh ready <record> <id> --head <sha>                     # 0 only if reviewed or fixed there
dispatch-record.sh close <record> <id> --verdict approved
dispatch-record.sh summary <record>
```

`review` records instead of `round` the head it read and whether the project's own norms tool ran (`tool`) or the project ships none (`none`). `fixed` records the ONE correction round at the head you verified on the artifact; with no review on the row, or a second time, it records and warns. `ready` stands in front of telling the operator a pull request is ready: it passes at the head the last review read or the one its correction round was verified at, and refuses any other; with no review on the row it warns. The pull request stays in draft: lifting it is the operator's by default.

**Read the summary before a wave, and revert what it names:**

```
signal=n-bis at light averages 2 rounds: the drop did not pay, revert it for this class
```

## The costliest mistakes

- A tier chosen from how hard the phase feels, or two steps at once — take the five readings.
- A wave dispatched without reading the map or the summary, or a signal in it left standing.
- A phase cascaded, or an escalation attempted inside a live session instead of as a rotation.
