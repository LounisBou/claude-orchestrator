# claude-orchestrator — design

Status: validated · Scope: a host plugin that packages the orchestration method, the terminal tab tooling and a context gauge that any session can read.

## 1. Goal

One session supervises implementer sessions instead of writing code itself: it writes their briefs, reviews every delivery on the artifact, rotates saturated agents and hands over to a successor before its own judgment degrades. This plugin ships that method as skills, the tab tooling the method needs on macOS, the briefs as templates, and a context gauge that does not depend on any particular status bar.

Everything here was extracted from a working setup: the skills existed as loose files in the user's config directory, the gauge was a patch inside an installed status-bar script, and the briefs were rewritten by hand for every phase. The plugin makes them installable, versioned and independent of that machine.

Skills reach their scripts through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`; a relative path does not resolve from a skill. Skills are invoked as `orchestrator:<skill>`.

## 3. Context gauge

### 3.1 Why two tiers

The host exposes the exact context fill in one place only: the JSON it writes to the status line command's stdin (`context_window.used_percentage`, `context_window.context_window_size`, a `current_usage` token breakdown, the 5-hour and 7-day quotas, `session_id` and `transcript_path` — field names read from a captured payload, not from documentation). Hooks do not carry it, and a plugin cannot declare a status line. A session can also compute its fill from its own transcript: the last `usage` block's input plus cache tokens is the context sent on the last turn, within half a point of the host's figure. The transcript needs the window size, which the payload carries as `context_window_size`.

So the gauge has a harness-exact tier fed by a status-line tap, and a computed tier from the transcript that needs no wiring at all. An idle session stops rendering its status line, so its tap file ages; the gauge then falls back to the transcript and says so.

### 3.2 The tap

`statusline-tap.sh [wrapped command...]` reads the payload from stdin, writes one file per session, then feeds the untouched payload to the wrapped command and exits with its status. With no wrapped command it prints a one-line `ctx: N% │ 5h: N% │ 7d: N%` so a user without a status bar still sees something.

The file is `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/claude-orchestrator/ctx/<session-id>.json`:

```json
{"session_id": "...", "context_percent": 36.4, "context_used": 91000, "context_total": 250000,
 "five_hour_percent": 3, "five_hour_resets_at": 1788560000,
 "seven_day_percent": 1, "seven_day_resets_at": 1788900000,
 "transcript_path": "/path/to/session.jsonl", "updated_epoch": 1788553115}
```

`context_used` is the sum of `current_usage`'s input, cache-creation and cache-read tokens; `context_total` is `context_window_size`; `transcript_path` lets the gauge open the transcript without guessing its location. One `jq` call parses the payload; missing fields become `null`. The file is written to a temporary name then renamed, so a reader never sees a partial file. Invalid or empty stdin writes nothing and still runs the wrapped command. On the first render of a session (no file yet) the tap deletes files older than one day, so ended sessions do not accumulate.

### 3.3 The gauge

`context-gauge.sh [session-id] [--window N] [--max-age S]` prints `key=value` lines:

```
context_percent=36.4
context_tokens=91000
context_window=250000
five_hour_percent=3
seven_day_percent=1
source=tap            # or transcript
```

The session id defaults to `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, which the host sets in every session's environment. The tap file is used when younger than `--max-age` (default 120 s). Otherwise the transcript — the path recorded in the tap file when there is one, else `<config>/projects/*/<session-id>.jsonl` — is scanned backwards for the last `usage` block. The window for that computation comes, in order, from the stale tap file's `context_total`, `--window`, or the default 200000, and `context_window_source=` names which. No tap file and no transcript is an error with exit 1.

### 3.4 Install and uninstall

`install.sh` copies the tap to `<config>/claude-orchestrator/statusline-tap.sh` (a stable path: the plugin cache path changes with every version), creates `ctx/`, then rewrites `statusLine.command` in `<config>/settings.json` as `<tap path> <previous command>`. The previous `statusLine` object is saved to `<config>/claude-orchestrator/statusline.previous.json` and `settings.json` is backed up under `<config>/backups/claude-orchestrator-<stamp>/`. Idempotent: a command already starting with the tap path is left alone. With no `statusLine` at all, the command becomes the tap alone. `--dry-run` prints and changes nothing.

`uninstall.sh` restores the saved `statusLine` (or deletes the key if there was none) and removes the state directory. The tap copy goes with it.

Requirements: `jq` for the tap and the installer, `python3` for the transcript scan, bash 3.2.

## 4. Skills

**orchestrator** is the rulebook as it stands, with three edits: script invocations go through the plugin root, briefs are instantiated from `templates/`, and the gauge is described by pointing at the `context-gauge` skill. Every project-specific fact is removed; the skill states the rule and leaves the project's policy (where briefs live, whether tests are committed, what the durable-artifact policy forbids) to the brief the orchestrator writes.

**iterm-agents** keeps `list`, `spawn`, `close`, `move`, `rotate`, with `--left-of` on `spawn` and `rotate`, and gains `verify`. Since 0.4.0 `spawn` writes the prompt to a file under the state directory and types a short command that reads it — a prompt typed by AppleScript is truncated past a few hundred characters and the command never runs — waits for the new tab's shell to be at a prompt (answering a startup yes/no question with « n », since 0.4.1) before typing, then waits for the host CLI on the new tty, re-types once if the shell is idle without it, and fails loudly if it never appears; quoting uses the shell's substitutions, never `sed`, which dies on a non-ASCII byte under a C locale. The layout convention is stated: the orchestrator's tab sits immediately left of its implementer's tab. The spawn prompt is a one-line "Read and execute <path>" naming the orchestrator's address.

**context-gauge** documents how a session reads its own fill, what each `source=` means, and the duty the orchestrator puts in every brief: report the measured figure, never an estimate.

## 5. Templates

Three Markdown briefs with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers, each carrying the sections the orchestrator skill makes mandatory:

- **agent-phase-brief**: required reading, environment with state-verification commands, scope with contracts verbatim and a non-goals list ending in the STOP-and-ask clause, method, forbidden list, communication protocol with the gauge invocation, delivery, resource envelope.
- **agent-rotation-brief**: phase state, branch state, remaining scope, decisions marked non-reopenable, same protocol.
- **orchestrator-succession-brief**: pointer-based (project state file, spec, plan, runbook, briefs directory), the successor's ordered first task (read, verify on artifacts, re-identify to live agents, confirm takeover, close the predecessor's tab), and the standing user rules that bind the successor.

A brief is written to a path the fresh session can open on its machine, never only into a session's context.

## 6. Commands

- `install` and `uninstall` run the scripts of §3.4 and report.
- `status` lists tap files younger than ten minutes with session id, context percent and age, next to the live-session list the host provides, so an orchestrator sees at a glance who is near the rotation gate.
- `succeed` executes the succession the orchestrator skill describes: refresh the standing brief from the template, spawn the successor with `--left-of` the implementer's tty, wait for the takeover confirmation, answer nothing new meanwhile.

## 7. Tests

`tests/run-tests.sh`, bash, no network, no terminal automation, isolated `HOME` per case:

- gauge: fresh tap file → `source=tap`; stale tap file plus fixture transcript → `source=transcript` with the window taken from the file; transcript only with `--window`; nothing → exit 1; session id from the environment variable.
- tap: file written with every field; payload passed byte-for-byte to the wrapped command and its exit status returned; no wrapped command → the one-line render; invalid stdin → no file, wrapped command still run; stale files pruned on first render.
- install: wraps an existing command, is idempotent on a second run, handles a settings file without `statusLine`, `--dry-run` changes nothing; uninstall restores the previous object exactly.
- iterm script: argument validation paths (`--tty` required, differing ttys) fail before any automation call.
- repository policy: the prose contains no vendor or product name outside the load-bearing identifiers.

## 8. Release

Version in `plugin.json`, tag `claude-orchestrator--v<version>` pushed with the code. Install:

```
/plugin marketplace add LounisBou/claude-orchestrator
/plugin install claude-orchestrator@claude-orchestrator
/orchestrator:install
```

## 9. Out of scope

Windows and Linux terminal automation (the iterm-agents skill is macOS only; the other two skills and the gauge work anywhere the host runs). A hook-based gauge: no hook event carries context usage. Editing the user's status line script: the tap wraps it, never patches it.

**decide** (0.4.2) is the decision round: the orchestrator collects every arbitration that is the user's — agents' STOPs, proposed owners, review findings without one — and puts them ONE AT A TIME, each with its context in plain words, two to four choices carrying their cost, one recommendation, then waits; the ruling is written back in one line, recorded where it lives, relayed to the agent it answers, and only then the next question comes. A question interrupted by anything else is re-presented in full, never referenced. Written after a day on which twelve arbitrations were put that way and every one was ruled in a minute, where batching them had stalled for hours.
