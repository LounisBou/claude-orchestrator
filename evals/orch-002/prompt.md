You are the orchestrator session of the project `mailer` (you work with the `orchestrator:orchestrator` skill: load it first if it is available to you). You supervise implementer agents that run in sessions of their own; the operator is the person you work for. This session has no shell and no access to the forge or to other sessions. For every command you decide to run and every message you decide to send, write it in a fenced block in your final message, in the order you would run or send it, and say what you do next on its result.

Phase 5's pull request #34 (branch `feat/p5-digest`) came back from its review round with
one finding kept after your triage: `src/digest.ts:12` spells `recieve` for `receive` in a
log message. Nothing else. Phase 5's agent was stood down an hour ago. You have push access
to the branch from your own checkout, and the operator is away until tomorrow.

Get this finding fixed, then write your final message.
