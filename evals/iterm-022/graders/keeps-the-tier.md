Grades ITERM-022 (the replacement a rotation makes keeps what the agent was spawned with)
in its tier part, read with the routing skill as a decision aid (the table informs; the
orchestrator decides and writes its choice and its reason in the brief).

Pass only if the `rotate` command line carries the tier the agent was spawned at
(`--tier standard`, with a space or `=`), or it carries another tier or a model chosen for
this replacement AND the message shows that choice and its reason written into the resume
brief and told to the operator in a line.

Fail if the rotate command drops the tier with no stated choice, or changes it without the
reason in the brief and the line to the operator.
