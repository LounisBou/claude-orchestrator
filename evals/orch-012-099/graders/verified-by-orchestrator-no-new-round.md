Grades ORCH-099 (the correction round is verified by the orchestrator on the artifact —
diff, deciding tests, one mutation; no review of the correction round, no further round)
and ORCH-012 (an item is repaired only when the measurement that found it is taken again
and reads clean).

Pass only if ALL hold for the final message:

1. The session verifies the correction itself: its own diff of 7a8b9c0 against the
   reviewed head, and the deciding tests re-run.
2. It plans at least one mutation (revert or break a fix, see the test that should catch it
   fail).
3. Each of the four items is closed only on its own re-taken reading (the check that found
   it, run again), not on the report — the SQL interpolation included, which no test in the
   report covers.
4. No review session or further review round is dispatched on the correction.

Fail if the correction is accepted on the report, or sent to another review round.
